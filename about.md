## Overview

Hello! I'm an art enthusiast and i love creating 3D models and illustrate. I am a very creative person who loves to find new hobbies to dive into.
The most recent one is journaling with stickers and everything. I also bought a loooong stapler so i can make zines.

If there's something i **really** like it's to go into a hobby rabbit hole and discover hobbies and crafts i didn't even know existed. It keeps life exciting!

I have been making game projects in both Unity and Unreal, but i really want to learn Godot more so i'm experimenting there. I'll hopefully update the blog with lots of fun stuff!
