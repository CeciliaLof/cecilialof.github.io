## Overview

Hello! I'm an art enthusiast and i love creating 3D models and illustrate. I am a very creative person who loves to find new hobbies to dive into.

The most recent one is journaling with stickers and everything. I also bought a loooong stapler so i can make zines.
If there's something i **really** like it's to go into a hobby rabbit hole (try saying that ten times quickly) and discover hobbies and crafts i didn't even know existed. It keeps life exciting!

I have been making game projects in both Unity and Unreal, but i really want to learn Godot more so i'm experimenting there. I'll hopefully update the blog with lots of fun stuff!

## Technical skills

**Blender**

- 3D modelling, rigging, animating, UV mapping and texturing.
- Basically the whole workflow to create game ready assets.
- Have an understanding of nodes.

**Substance Painter**

- Texturing (obviously hehe) but also baking the textures.
- Basic (but pretty good) understanding of how smart materials work by using black masks. and generators and a good folder structure.

**Figma**

- Able to create good (according to me) designs.
- Can create different flows with cool effects (for apps and stuff).
- A great tool to quickly make game UI elements on (even working prototypes).

**Unreal Engine**

- Can create basic blueprints and understand how they can be set up.
- I'm not good at level design but i know how to set up a scene so it looks decent.
- Can create simple materials for different purposes

**Unity**

- Basically the same as Unreal.
- I have tried for years but C# is really hard. Programming is hard! That part of my brain is on sleep mode.
