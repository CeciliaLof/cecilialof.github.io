          I really really want to buy some pens. When life feels a little rough,
          pens do the trick. Or any stationery really. Notebooks, sketchbooks,
          pens, erasers, sharpeners, weird markers... It just makes me happier!
          Not expensive either, so pretty harmless.

        <h2>☀Weather report</h2>
        <p>
          There was <i>supposed</i> to be rain and thunder. We just got a little
          shower. We really hoped it would cool us of but it did not, and it
          made the whole apartment <b>moist</b>. GREAT!<br />
          Don't get me wrong, i love the summer! But i also really love rain,
          and thunderstorms especially are super cozy.
        </p>
        <h2>Plans for tomorrow</h2>
        <p>
          Other than focusing on enjoying the summer with my family, i will
          focus on applying for jobs. Hopefully i'll get a job offer soon so i
          too can provide for our family just like my fiancé.
          <i>"Good things come to those who wait"</i> as they say.

          Today i worked on this website to make it my own. I have honestly been
          thinking about this site the entire day. My philosophy is to create it
          for <b>me</b> and not for anyone else. I usually think about what
          others will think, but this is <i>my personal site</i> so why would i
          try and change it for others?

        <h2>~Things i love with this site~</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The compact style, everything is small and in their own little
            square. It's cozy somehow, hard to explain.
          </li>
          <li>
            The small font, i love how tiny and retro it feels. It's fantastic!
          </li>
          <li>
            The fact that i can make useless lists like this. It's my site, i do
            whatever i want.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bringing back "old school" internet like it used to be. I don't like
            social media at all!
          </li>
          <li>Honestly, the fact that i didn't make a mobile version.</li>
