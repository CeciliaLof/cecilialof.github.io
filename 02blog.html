          So i had a hard time actually knowing <b>what</b> to draw. But i have
          been sketching and sketching. I really like the concept of people
          having horns because it looks badass to me and i like drawing horns,
          so i settled with some kind of demon character design. I have only
          done one sketch so far, but my next course of action is to make a
          front and side view of the character.
        </p>
        <h2>the sketch</h2>
        <p>
          The character will have clothes eventually but i couldn't decide on a
          fashion style, so this will do for now. I will figure it out as i get
          further.

          Today is the day i start working on a new Blender project! I usually
          just play around and make stuff, but now i want to creat a full game
          character from start to finish. This means that i have to be happy
          with the design first before jumping into the 3D stuff.
        </p>
        <h2>ðŸ–ŠProject plan breakdown</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Sketch out a character design that i like</li>
          <li>
            Illustrate a full body front and side view to be used as a 3D
            reference.
          </li>
          <li>
            Model the character! It's important to think of the polycount, it
            will make the next steps so much easier.
          </li>
          <li>UV unwrap the character.</li>
          <li>Texture the character in Substance Painter.</li>
          <li>
            Rig the character, and maybe make a couple of animations or poses to
            showcase it.
          </li>
          <li>Post it in my projects site!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Follow along with me!</h2>
        <p>
          My plan is to post noteworthy updates here on my blog so you can
          follow along. I will give some tips along the way, such as modeling
          tips, creative tips and so on. I have learned some things and i'll
          gladly share them with you!
          <br /><br />Each project will get it's own personal hashtag so it will
          be easier to filter through them later on.
        </p>
        <h2>Project <b>Aurora</b></h2>
        <p>
          As the title says, this project i will be working on is called project
          #aurora. A fitting name for a first project in the northern
          scandinavia, don't you think?<br />

              border="0"
          /></a>
          <br />
          I already have some base ideas for this character:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A cool/tough female character.</li>
          <li>Modern clothes/style.</li>
          <li>
            Fantasy features, like horns or something. Someting <i>unique</i>,
            but not <i>too</i> unique to prevent clutter.
          </li>
        </ul>

          I really really want to buy some pens. When life feels a little rough,
          pens do the trick. Or any stationery really. Notebooks, sketchbooks,
          pens, erasers, sharpeners, weird markers... It just makes me happier!
          Not expensive either, so pretty harmless.
        </p>
        <h2>â˜€Weather report</h2>
        <p>
          There was <i>supposed</i> to be rain and thunder. We just got a little
          shower. We really hoped it would cool us of but it did not, and it
          made the whole apartment <b>moist</b>. GREAT!<br />
          Don't get me wrong, i love the summer! But i also really love rain,
          and thunderstorms especially are super cozy.
        </p>
        <h2>Plans for tomorrow</h2>
        <p>
          Other than focusing on enjoying the summer with my family, i will
          focus on applying for jobs. Hopefully i'll get a job offer soon so i
          too can provide for our family just like my fiancÃ©.
          <i>"Good things come to those who wait"</i> as they say.

          Today i worked on this website to make it my own. I have honestly been
          thinking about this site the entire day. My philosophy is to create it
          for <b>me</b> and not for anyone else. I usually think about what
          others will think, but this is <i>my personal site</i> so why would i
          try and change it for others?

        <h2>~Things i love with this site~</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The compact style, everything is small and in their own little
            square. It's cozy somehow, hard to explain.
          </li>
          <li>
            The small font, i love how tiny and retro it feels. It's fantastic!
          </li>
          <li>
            The fact that i can make useless lists like this. It's my site, i do
            whatever i want.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bringing back "old school" internet like it used to be. I don't like
            social media at all!
          </li>
          <li>Honestly, the fact that i didn't make a mobile version.</li>
