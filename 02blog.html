        <p>
          Today i worked on this website to make it my own. I have honestly been
          thinking about this site the entire day. My philosophy is to create it
          for <b>me</b> and not for anyone else. I usually think about what
          others will think, but this is <i>my personal site</i> so why would i
          try and change it for others?

          <h2>~Things i love with this site~</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The compact style, everything is small and in their own little square.
              It's cozy somehow, hard to explain.</li>
            <li>The small font, i love how tiny and retro it feels. It's fantastic!</li>
            <li>The fact that i can make useless lists like this. It's my site, i do whatever i want.</li>
            <li>Bringing back "old school" internet like it used to be. I don't like social media at all!</li>
            <li>Honestly, the fact that i didn't make a mobile version.</li>
          </ul>
