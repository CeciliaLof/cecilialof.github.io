        <h2>What is The Bitter End?</h2>
        <p>
          <b><i>The Bitter End</i></b> was a game project me and two other
          studends created for the course <i>Future Studies</i> in university,
          where we had to use two future study methods and apply it to a digital
          media production area. We chose gaming since it's an interest for us.
          We picked the study methods <i>Scenario Planning</i> and
          <i>Trend Analysis</i>.
          <br />
          The game took around three weeks from start to finish, a short
          timespan for such a ambitious idea. The goal and theme of the study
          was how AI will be implemented in gaming in the future. We picked a
          scenario where you could type anything you wanted and the NPC will
          reply. <br />
          This game was just a prototype so no real AI was involved in the
          gameplay, we instead used ChatGPT to decide what the dialogue would be
          beforehand as a script.

        <p>
          You play as a guard tasked to solve a murder. One patron in the bar is
          the guilty one, you have to talk to them and find clues, and in the
          end you decide who is the guilty one.

        <h2>My Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          My sole responsibility was to create the 3D assets for the game.
          Everything from the bottles scattered around the tavern, to the one
          man squid band playing a jazzy tune. I was also responsible for the
          overall environment mood, such as shading, lighting and placing the
          assets.
