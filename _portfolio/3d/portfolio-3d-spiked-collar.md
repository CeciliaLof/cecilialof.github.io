# Spiked Collar

Sculpted and painted in Blender with vertex painting. Sometimes i just want to let loose and don't think about the topology or any other technical stuff. It's just pure digital sculpting!

The coloring was done with vertex painting, so no texture was used at all. I used different vertex paints to achieve different effects, for example the beauty spots were a whole separate vertex paint layer, same with the vitiligo.

The skin texture was done with a bumb map and some noise. The lips were also a vertex layer mask painted with black and connected to the roughness in the principled BDSF node. And to add that skin touch i cranked up the SSS. The ears are my favourite.
The model itself is actually sculpted from a photo reference, you can see it at the bottom!

The images were actually rendered with a transparent background, then i added a background layer in the built in compositor to adjust it to my liking.
After the images were rendered, i did some work in Photoshop to add a simple photo grain to tie it all together.
