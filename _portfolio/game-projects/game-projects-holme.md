# Holme

This is a project me and my friend Lina is working on. It started out as many ideas at the same time but we are slowly working out, chiseling away, at the core gameplay.
We are letting ourselves be free and creative and create lots of ideas instead of just restricting ourselves.
One day we are working on chopping wood, another day day/night cycle, another day farming.
It's gonna be a cozy game.
The style has changed quite a bit too, it started out as a classic stylized Unreal style game, but i felt restricted.

The details were too visible and honestly that stresses me out too much, so i suggested the low poly pixelated style (_like Valheim/Obenseuer/Abiotic Factor_)
All the pressure just.. dissappeared! I went from exhausted to excited again, you can hide the flaws better and it still looks nice!

I really want to dig into character creation by creating blend shapes that can be used to create sliders in Unreal to drag different features. And then be able to change haircut and such.

- One day we will have some kind of release date but our ambitions are very high. Maybe at least create some kind of playable demo. That's our plan!

- Our mantra is: make it exist first, make it good later! So if something is not perfect, we leave it and move on. At least it exists.

_Player house. Pretty proud of this one, i've been scared of making houses, obsessing over the most insignificant things such as "what if the textures are off here?". This style is so forgiving that it gives me the freedom to just do it._

_Yeah you get the vibe. It's beautiful but honestly, not my style. I prefer the more "crisp chunky messy" vibe._
