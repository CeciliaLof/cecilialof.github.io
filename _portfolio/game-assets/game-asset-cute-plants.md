# Cute Plants

I'm a big fan of the style that [Obenseuer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/951240/Obenseuer/) and [Valheim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/) has, and i've always wanted to know how to create these kinds of textures and models. I overthought a lot and thought it was super hard, but it was not.

When i finally figured out how to make it, and make it styled the way i wanted, it just flowed and it's a fantastic feeling when everything just **clicks**!

_I'll eventually create a tutorial for it_
