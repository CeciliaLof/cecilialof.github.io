# Clouds

**I love clouds so much!** I have a huge collection of photos on my phone consisting of different clouds i find interesting. I adore the beautiful illustrations people make and i can lose myself in them. So i started trying to learn it myself.
So far i haven't done that many but hopefully my interest for practicing clouds will return so i can keep on doing it. I love experimenting with different artstyles so don't expect too much from me.

I have Procreate on my iPad and i want to be able to chill on the couch and paint clouds but i can't ever be comfortable when using it, i keep accidentaly touching the surface with my hand, maybe i need a drawing glove or something.

_Have you ever seen the meme where the supermarket parking lots always have the prettiest sunsets and clouds? The photo reference i took for this one was actually taken in front of a Bauhaus parking lot!_
