# Devlog 1 - Let's do this!

![](https://blob.gifcities.org/gifcities/GTGG6JOQI7VJREMEY5VKAO6UWKX5SREX.gif){: .click-to-enlarge} Started up a Godot project and just went to town with CSG shapes, and some lights and glass just to get the feel. Later on when i'm happy with the base layout, which i think i am, i will export it to blender and switch out to my own models instead.

### But the most important step is done; my character can walk!

Next step is to model everything in Blender!
