# My very first blog post!

_First of all, how fantastic it is to finally understand a static website generator?!_

I thought it felt so complicated to use html to make blog posts, it eventually got so messy with a specific div for each post and it was a nightmare to manage. This is just different markdown files without all that html code crap.
This is much more managable and markdown is something you learn so quickly too!

I'm working on making a markdown cheat sheet for myself in the [tutorials](/tutorials/) section but you're free to be inspired there too. It's mostly for me to see how it looks with the theme and to remember what to type.
