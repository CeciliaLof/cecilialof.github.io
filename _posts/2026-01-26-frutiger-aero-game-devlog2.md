# Frutiger Aero Game Devlog 2

## Things are getting exciting!

## ![](https://blob.gifcities.org/gifcities/ZDZH67KVKKWLQN2WYBHJESMII6EVVE56.gif)

I felt like building a level in godot felt a bit clunky so i just made a simple room in Blender and played around a little and imported it. Boom. It looks much much better. I have a better sense of scale now.
The lobby is now a small room with a little aquarium in the corner. The whole room is floating but i'm gonna add a balcony so it stands on pillars.

---

The office building will be standing on pillars/legs above a grassy terrain, and i will try and make the rooms modular and separate from each other.
I'm not the best at understanding scenes, but now the main scene has all the stuff in it, but eventually i could probably put all the items i want in the lobby scene and then put that entire lobby scene in the main.

_I need a name for this game but i'm not sure what it would be._

# Screenshots

## All models so far are placeholders.

# Next steps

## Now what?

Since i have a room i can walk around in, i'm gonna add that sliding door and opening so the lobby mesh is complete.
