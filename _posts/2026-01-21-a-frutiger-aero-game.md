# Ok so hear me out-

Have you seen the fruitger aero style? Many describe it as "the future we were promised but never got". It's the windows vista style. Glass, saturated nature, blue, dolphins, water droplets. Fresh, juicy, futuristic, y2k.

I like the backrooms games where you just roam around and explore, and i thought to myself "Why don't i - a game developer (or at least a very delulu person who thinks she can develop games) create something like this myself?"
And not only that, create it in Godot; the engine i've always wanted to try properly with 3D. So far i've only done 2D projects.

# The story (subject to change)

(First person view, 3D game)
You start in a lobby, and there's a couch and a reception disk. A notification is ringing on the reception desk and there's some kind of screen where you can answer. It's a chat where the employer is asking you questions and you reply (pre made answers you can click and choose from).

**An example**

_Hello and welcome to Tech Supreme Office, i'm Sophie, and i will be conducting this introductory interview with you. What is your name?_

**-Emma-**

**-Joann-**

**-Mike-**

(And some more generic questions, just for the player to get the immersion)

_Great, thank you for your time! Your main interview will start in about 5 minutes, sit down and grab a cup of tea and we will come for you soon._

**Chat ended**

But here's the deal, the interviewer _never arrives_. There will be a clock on the wall that tracks time and you will notice that eventually an hour has passed (maybe the in game time will be 6 minutes for an hour instead of 60 just to speed things up).

So the player gets up and walks away into the corridors to find out what happened. Maybe nothing happened, maybe the office is just a lie, maybe they are all aliens, maybe it's some kind of backrooms. A liminal space you can't escape. Maybe you are dead?

I have no idea, but i can see the game in front of me and that fuels my curiosity enough to make it possible. This will also be pretty simple to model too, since i don't have to model people or animations.
Stationery objects are much simpler to put in a game, and i can also bake the lighting.

So here we are, this grand idea. Such a simple project too, make character walk, that's it. Make it exist first and make it good later, right?

This will give me a chance to dive into sleek frutiger aero UI elements, bubbly sound effects and maybe some nice chill (i'm probably gonna find some royalty free) music, and create glossy furniture made out of plastic and lush nature.

**I'm gonna post some updates later on, i will eventually create some kind of tag system for my blog posts so they can be filtered (so all posts tagged frutiger-aero-project can be found).**
