    <h2>current obsession</h2>
    <p>
      I've been really into <b>tempeh</b> lately, i really like the nutty
      savoury flavour of it. I need to experiment more with different recipes,
      for now i've only fried it and put it on top of a salad.<br />
      I once ate a tempeh burger at a restaurant called BÃ¥ten BÃ¥ten (the boat
      boat, super silly name i know ðŸ˜…). It was delicious! I've been chasing
      that flavour since, too bad they removed it from their menu... Oh well!
