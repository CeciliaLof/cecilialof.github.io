              These are my absolute favourite pancakes i've ever made (and trust
              me, i've tried many pancake recipes). They stay together properly
              and are chewy and stretchy. The recipe comes from
              <a
                href="https://javligtgott.se/recept/veganska-pannkakor/"
                target="_blank"
                >here</a
              >
              originally. <br /><br />My suggestion is to let the butter melt
              completely until it stops bubbling. The first pancake is always
              the worst, it's a <i>sacrifice</i> to the pancake overlords. After
              this the pan will have heated up properly. You don't need much
              batter really, barely a dl. Make sure to tilt the pan to properly
              fill it. The pancakes are not supposed to be thick!
